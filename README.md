# Set Origin in Edit Mode Addon

This addon adds a `Set Origin to Selected` option to the right-click menu in Edit Mode.

### Motivation

The usual way to set the origin to selected vertices/edges/faces is this:

1. Select the vertex/vertices/edges/faces that you want to set the origin to in edit mode.
2. `Shift + S` to bring up the 3D cursor menu and select `Cursor to Selected`
3. `Tab` into Object Mode.
4. Right-click on the active object and select `Set Origin > Origin to 3D Cursor`

Now you have the origin where you want it, except you moved the 3D cursor and you are in Object Mode. Also, this is a quite complex series of steps to remember for something that should be trivial.

This addon simplifies the process by adding a `Set Origin to Selected` option to the right-click menu in Edit Mode.
